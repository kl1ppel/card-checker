# Card Checker

**Card Checker** is a Python-based educational project that demonstrates how to implement the **Luhn algorithm** for credit-card number validation. In addition to Luhn checks, it includes:

- Expiry date and CVV verification  
- Rotating proxies and User-Agent headers  
- Retry/backoff logic for robust HTTP requests  
- A simple CLI interface with progress bars  

This project is designed for study purposes, helping you learn real-world patterns in request handling and data validation.
